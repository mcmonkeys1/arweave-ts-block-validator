# Arweave Typescript Block Validator
an arweave block validator, nothing more

** (Under development, not for production) **

## Installation

~~First clone the repo & enter the root folder~~

~~## Build node-randomx addon~~

~~*this is a bit hacky, but please follow along~~

## Clone the repo & build the block validator

```
npm install
```

## Now you can run the tests 

`npm run test` - to run most unit tests

`npm run start:pow` - to run separate RandomX unit test

`npm run test:e2e` - for complete end to end testing


## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble installing on any version of Windows apart from Windows 10 x64, you may need to install node-gyp for compiling the node-randomx library first:

```
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```
